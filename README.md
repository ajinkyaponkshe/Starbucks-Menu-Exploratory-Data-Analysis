I have analyzed Starbucks Food menu and answered the following basic data manipulation questions; 

1. Basic Look at the data
2. Which product have maximul Calories?
3. Which Product has maximum Cholesterol?
4. Name the product having maximum calories and minimum Cholesterol
5. Find number Products having more than 400 calories and more than 60 grms of cholesterol
    We can find answer of 5th question by two ways; first is use .loc and len function
    or we can use use apply and lamda function
  
6. Scatterplot representation of Starbucks's Food menu category
7. Check the outliers in Cholesterol
8. Check relation between Calories and Cholesterol
